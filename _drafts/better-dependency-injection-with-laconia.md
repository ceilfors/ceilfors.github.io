Dependency Injection is an important design pattern in any software development
paradigm, including the Serverless world. In AWS Lambda, I was not
satisfied with any of the approach that I have found. I have covered
this topic previously and [come up with a simple convention](https://www.ceilfors.com/2017/12/03/dependency-injection-in-aws-lambda-nodejs.html).
That convention works, but I really want to see if I can make it better.
Introducing [Laconia](https://github.com/ceilfors/laconia).

Laconia is a micro framework that I've been developing recently. It is taking a
very lightweight approach to tackle the DI problem, and specifically designed for
Lambda. Package size matters for your Lambda performance, Laconia DI package size
is currently only about 12 KB when zipped.

# The Handler

I'm going to a use a similar scenario that I have used in my previous blog post,
simply, we have a Lambda that will always return a list of tweets from user id 1000.

With Laconia, the Lambda can be written like so:

```js
const { laconia } = require("laconia-core");

// Create dependencies
const instances = async () => {
  const password = await getPassword();
  return { twitterService: new TwitterService(password) };
};

// Grab the dependency you need by destructuring
const handler = ({ twitterService }) => {
  return twitterService.getLatestTweets(1000);
};

// Bootstrap laconia
exports.handler = laconia(handler).register(instances);
```

TBD That's it! notice how blah blah

## Unit Testing

In our unit test, weâ€™d like to make sure that this Lambda is unit tested by verifying that the number 1000 (think user id)
is used when tweets are being retrieved.

Let's see how we can test the lambda code that we have written in the previous section.
As unit testing is a first class citizen in Laconia, Laconia
provides `run` method to run your Lambda handler code without worrying on
your dependencies instantiation. Let's see the following example.

```js
const lambda = require("./lambda");

let twitterService;

beforeEach("mock dependency", () => {
  // No `exports` hack anymore
  twitterService = { getLatestTweets: jest.mock() };
  twitterService.getLatestTweets.returns(Promise.resolve());
});

it("should get tweets for user 1000", () => {
  // No need to require a different function to test your logic
  return lambda.run({ twitterService });
  expect(twitterService.getLatestTweets).toBeCalledWith(1000);
});
```

## The Laconia Context

When you use Laconia, your dependencies will live around an object
called LaconiaContext. LaconiaContext is the object that we have been
destructuring in handler function to retrieve `twitterService`,
and the object that we have created in the unit test to pass `twitterService`.

_Everything that your Lambda needs_ will be contained by LaconiaContext.
This is a very simple and important concept in Laconia. Notice how AWS `event` and
`context` objects are not in sights anymore. These AWS objects lives inside LaconiaContext.
Intuitively, they are accessible in your handler function via `event` and `context`
keys:

```js
const handler = ({ event, context }) => {};
```

It is very common to configure your Lamdba via environment variables. LaconiaContext
also contains the `process.env` object and make it available via `env` key:

```js
const handler = ({ env }) => {
  console.log(env.MY_ENV_VAR);
};
```

You might ask why would I need to access my environment variables this way?
This is again due to testability. If you use `process.env` in your code, you'd have to set
the enviroment variables you need in your unit test. You'll also have to make sure
that you are resetting the environment variables after your test run to make sure that
it doesn't interfere with your other test scenarios for example.

## Closing

Laconia makes it possible for you to semantically split the responsibility
of dependencies creation and your handler logic. Declaring the dependencies that
you need in the handler function is made lightweight by just using destructuring.

I also believe that a well written Lambda should be small and cohesive, hence
there should not be a need of having an automatic dependencies wiring. This is reflected
by the need of creating those objects manually in your code.

Unit testing is a first class citizen in Laconia, hence there is no need to use any
additional testing library to mock the dependency creation step. There is also no need
to have a workaround like exporting the _real handler_ function differently or using
the `exports` object like what I have covered in my previous test.

Lastly, Laconia is still very new, please comment if you have any feedback on this
framework!
