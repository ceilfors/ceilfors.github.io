This post captures my learnings from the
[The London Lead Developer 2018](https://london2018.theleaddeveloper.com/) conference.

# No one knows your job, except you

> The higher up you go, fewer people will tell you you're messing up.
> You become the person most equipped to know what's going wrong, and fix it.
> So how to know when you're messing up? Self-awareness
>
> _- @aliciatweet_

You are supposed to code. No, you are supposed to embrace no coding life. I think, you are too busy
lately in a meeting and not spending enough time with the team. Enough, you are coding too much.

If you have been in a Tech Lead position for quite some time, you should be very familiar
with this problem. Everyone around you will a different expectation on
what you role should be. _Always read the the job description_, said @danpersa. Company A
might see Tech Lead as a Engineering Manager, Company B might see Tech Lead as a Lead Developer,
Company C see Tech Lead as an Architect.

@kevingoldsmith shared a good tips on how you should be handling this situation. Creating a
_joint working agreement_ by sticky notes brainstorming with your colleauges,
on your first ever 1:1. The brainstorming session would be about
sharing the expectations the two of you have on each other. At the end of the session,
go through each cards and make sure that a common understanding is reached.

Feedback, feedback, feedback, it goes without saying and almost every speakers
reiterated the importance of feedback. I highly recommend you to gather feedback on every 1:1s.
Sometimes feedback can sometime only do so much, which is why @aliciatweet talked about
the importance of self-awareness.

So, should you code or not as a Tech Lead? That will be a topic for another day.

# The cost of improvements that no one talks about

In a team improvement effort, process has always been the lowest hanging fruit. It is
important to improve your process, but always keep an eye of the cultural shifts in your team
as the result of a process change as it might go into a negative direction.

This is why I find @pia_nillson's talk to be very interesting. She suggests the optimisation of work
that you are doing correlates to higher friction, which makes a lot of sense! Pairing forces you
to communicate to your pair for the entire day. I've also heard a lot of developers struggling to
pair due to various reasons. Limiting WIP will force multiple pairs to collaborate
on a single end-to-end story and complete them together. She recommends a couple of antidotes,
each of which worth Googling for:

1.  Psychological safety: Confidence I won’t be blamed or laughed at if I make a mistake.
    Ask stupid questions, "I think this sucks" > "This sucks", appreciation in retrospective.
2.  Active listening: Don't interrupt.
    Yes and’ technique to build on others’ idea
3.  Friendly feedback: Non-Violent Communication
    Turn up the Good: Focus on what’s going well and turn that up (retrospective)
4.  Answer Why: Purpose of the team
    OKR, Goal must not have solution, "Despicable design"

Putting team improvements aside, the other improvements that you might want to have
is on technology. New technologies, aren't they exciting? Containers are still on the rise
and a lot of teams want to adopt them. _Containers need headcount_, said @alicegoldfuss.
This should be quite an eye opener for a team that wants to build a container platform.
The list of skills that she thinks is required to setup a team to manage this (yes, a team is required):
operations, deployment, monitoring, networking, kernel engineer, infosec, internal adoption,
project manager. You should at least have 4 people, with a maximum of 8 people in the team.
There is no such thing as a free lunch.

# Delivering business values, together

Pia briefly talks about this in Spotify where people are always static.
xxx also briefly said that in the currendy industry, we expect people to
be moving around every 6 to 8 months. This `distraction` brings a very
interesting question.

I've long argued that a productive team is a team that have shared business
goals to be tackled together. OKR will help. Jenny covers this extensively e.g.
don't solutionise etc.

Last but not least, on boarding process matters. You have to remember that
building a team is not a one-off process, and you should always strive
to make things happen even when you are not around. This is one of the process
that will outlive you. Make sure that most documentation are updated and easy
for people to get context of what we are going on.

> First, try 3 value based questions. Can we BIN it - do we need to do it?
> Can the THIN it - take a story and make it less? Can we build the 20% that delivers 80% value?
> Can we SPLIT it, to more than one story that provides customer value?
> BIN, THIN, SPLIT - we have smaller stories - but they still deliver values.
> Talk about value, not size or effort.

# Growth of others, and you

> Don't praise the knowledge, praise thethirst for knowledge - ClareSudbery

> A gardener doesn't tell plants how to grow. They create the best environment for plants to flourish, but you still need to know how to garden and what to weed out - @aliciatweet

Junior.next() talks about the importance of helping junior growing.
Internship

> Supporters, you can invest your time, create opportunities, and give feedback - @tara_ojo

Some talks are very new Leads, some are for higher ups.
Alicia Liu and Christian (scaling the team) talks about the importance
of maintaining your mental health. Exercise and meditation were recommended.

> You need stress to grow, but also need time to recover from stress - @aliciatweet

> Reading is important too - a lot of successful people credit reading - @cmccarrick
