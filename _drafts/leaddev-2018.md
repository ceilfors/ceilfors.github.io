You are supposed to code. No, you are supposed to embrace the life of no coding. I think, you are too busy
lately in meetings and not spending enough time with the team. Enough, you are coding too much.

If you have been in a Tech Lead position for quite some time, you should be very familiar
with this problem. Everyone around you will a different expectation on
what you role should be, and I'm not only talking about the coding expectation of your role.
_Always read the the job description_, said @danpersa. Company A
might see Tech Lead as a Engineering Manager, Company B might see Tech Lead as a Lead Developer,
Company C see Tech Lead as an Architect. This is a good tip if you are looking for a new job.
I have a broader thoughts, but it'll be covered by another blog post to focus on the conference.

If you are consultant like me, @kevingoldsmith shared a good tip on how you should be handling this situation
when you are switching from one project to another. The tips can of course be applied more broadly.
Brainstorm with your colleagues with sticky notes to create a
_joint working agreement_, on your first 1:1. The brainstorming session would be about
sharing the expectations the two of you have on each other. At the end of the session,
go through each cards and make sure that a common understanding is reached.

Feedback, feedback, feedback, it goes without saying and almost every speakers
reiterated the importance of feedback. I highly recommend you to gather feedback on every 1:1s.
Sometimes feedback can sometime only do so much, which is why @aliciatweet talked about
the importance of self-awareness.

# The cost of improvements that no one talks about

In a team improvement effort, process has always been the lowest hanging fruit. It is
important to improve your process, but always keep an eye of the cultural shifts in your team
as the result of a process change as it might go into a negative direction.

> - @pia_nillson.

This is why I find @pia_nillson's talk to be very interesting. She suggests the optimisation of work
that you are doing correlates to higher friction, which makes a lot of sense! Pairing forces you
to communicate to your pair for the entire day. I've also heard a lot of developers struggling to
pair due to various reasons. Limiting WIP will force multiple pairs to collaborate
on a single end-to-end story and complete them together. She recommends a couple of antidotes,
each of which worth Googling for:

1.  Psychological safety: Confidence I won’t be blamed or laughed at if I make a mistake.
    Ask stupid questions, "I think this sucks" > "This sucks", appreciation in retrospective.
2.  Active listening: Don't interrupt.
    Yes and’ technique to build on others’ idea
3.  Friendly feedback: Non-Violent Communication
    Turn up the Good: Focus on what’s going well and turn that up (retrospective)
4.  Answer Why: Purpose of the team
    OKR, Goal must not have solution, "Despicable design"

Putting team improvements aside, the other improvements that you might want to have
is on technology. New technologies, aren't they exciting? Containers are still on the rise
and a lot of teams want to adopt them. "Containers need headcount", said @alicegoldfuss.
This should be quite an eye opener for a team that wants to build a container platform.
The list of skills that she thinks is required to setup a team to manage this (yes, a team is required):
operations, deployment, monitoring, networking, kernel engineer, infosec, internal adoption,
project manager. You should at least have 4 people, with a maximum of 8 people in the team.
There is no such thing as a free lunch.

# Countering distraction with goal setting

A couple of speakers briefly talked about how a team is never static nowadays.
There is always a change in a team. A team will be _distracted_ whether a change is due to
a team member change, a senior leadership change, a priority change,
reorganisation, or even just a desk move.
It is therefore important for a team to always be prepared for a change.

> Define a single clear goal.
>
> _-@jenny_duckett_

It is too easy for developers to lose the big picture when they are focused
on solving a specific problems or even user story. Regardless of the distraction
your team have, this problem must be counteracted by defining a team's goal.
Regularly show how your team's work fits in the bigger picture and relate it
to the team's goal. As per what @danpetsa said, you must unlearn the principle of DRY in this
context, repeating yourself is key! A specific process of setting a goal can be adopted
from Google, it's called OKR (as covered in the previous section).

The goal that you are setting or trying to achieve should also be aligned with
delivering real values to your team's users or customers.
There is no point in achieving a goal that does not delivering business values, nor it
be helpful to counter team's distraction.

> BIN, THIN, SPLIT - we have smaller stories - but they still deliver values.
> Talk about value, not size or effort.
>
> - @adrianh

People who have worked with me will often hear me say "Cut the fat, maybe also the muscle,
delivery only the bone". This similar to what @adrianh has recommended, except for the fact
that it's less horrid:

1.  Can we BIN it - do we need to do it?
2.  Can we THIN it - take a story and make it less? Can we build the 20% that delivers 80% value?
3.  Can we SPLIT it - to more than one story that provides customer value?

# Growth of others, and yours

The last section but not the least. Most of the conference attendees were probably
interested in upskilling themselves. Fortunately a lot of speakers have reminded us
that growing others are equally important (and that's part of your job).

> A gardener doesn't tell plants how to grow.
> They create the best environment for plants to flourish,
> but you still need to know how to garden and what to weed out
> _-@aliciatweet_

Multiple levels of growth that you can are covered by the conference:
interns, juniors, experienced, and yourself.

> You can invest your time, create opportunities, and give feedback
> _-@tara_ojo_

It's quite a revelation to hear from @WebDevBev on how difficult it is
to get into tech industries. She couldn't join appreticeship as she owns a non-tech
degree. The apprenticeship system just excludes her rightaway. She couldn't join
a bootcamp as it will cost her £8000. She couldn't join an unpaid internship,
as she has a dependant. If you have an intern in your team, it goes away saying,
invest your time while the person is in your team.

@tara_ojo has conveniently provided a pratical tips on how you can invest your time
to grow interns and juniors:

1.  Stretch them. I always used the Goldilocks principle, or shoe sizing
2.  Keep track of their achievement, this will help on their promotion
3.  Pairing, give them the keyboard
4.  Give feedback

> Don't praise the knowledge, praise thethirst for knowledge
> _-@ClareSudbery_

There is a reason why @ClareSudbery has dedicated an entire talk on growth of
experienced developers, because it is hard. She reiterated the significance of empathy,
which should not be excluded even for experienced developers. One of the key takeaway for
me is on the tips for _praising_. On my entire career, it is very rare (probably never) for me
to praise other developers as I need developers to continuously be curious and learn
on their intrinsic value (praising is extrinsic). You don't want a developer to do something
just to be praised by someone. Which is why what she said on praising strucks me, I'll
definitely give it another thought:

> Leading takes energy, and you can't lead when you are burnout or ill
> _-@cmccarrick_

Now, back to you. I won't be covering much here except for the fact that the speakers who
are sitting on the higher ups (above Lead developer role) were talking about health. These speakers
were @cmccarrick (SVP of Platform Engineering) and @aliciatweet (VP of Engineering). In simple words,
if you are looking to step up your career, be also ready to step up your stress handling skills.
Leading takes energy, and you can't lead when you are burnout or ill. The unanimous tips to recover or
handle stress were regular meditation and regular exercise. Yes, I repeated the word _regular_ twice.

That's all for now, good luck!
