# Don't forget about the humans

# What makes a team, a team?

Pia briefly talks about this in Spotify where people are always static.
xxx also briefly said that in the currendy industry, we expect people to
be moving around every 6 to 8 months. This `distraction` brings a very
interesting question.

I've long argued that a productive team is a team that have shared business
goals to be tackled together. OKR will help. Jenny covers this extensively e.g.
don't solutionise etc.

Last but not least, on boarding process matters. You have to remember that
building a team is not a one-off process, and you should always strive
to make things happen even when you are not around. This is one of the process
that will outlive you. Make sure that most documentation are updated and easy
for people to get context of what we are going on.

# Learn from non-software industries

Nick Means smashed it again with his story. The story that has been told here
is a story from other industry. This time, it's a Nuclear Reactor plant.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident. I'll not cover in depth
on what's going on, but I'd recommend you to watch this talk when it's made available!

Broken windows theory for example is also happening in the accident.
In the operations office, there are a wall of alarms. When one of the alarm is triggered
off, no one notices as there are always 50 alarms that no one cares about!

Historical learning is one of the thing that frequently happens in software development team.
New people always come to a new team with all of their previous learnings from other teams.
The problem is, sometimes the learning that we have are not always applicable in every team
due to fundamental differences e.g. culture, dynamic. This accident shows an interesting
related issue where the engineers make a false decision based on a smaller scale reactor plant,
due to their experience in the Navy.

# Coding or no coding?

xyz talks about raeding job description.

Rule of thumb is:
30% coding
Remember to scale yourself as per xyz said, you might not be needed in that meeting. Delegate, or ignore.

If you are always stuck in a meeting, you are doing it wrong. I wouldn't call myself
a Lead Dev when this happens, I'd call myself Lead Meeting Manager or something.

Embrace "interruptions" ??

About coding. The truth is, most other people in different roles won't know what you
are doing anyway! In my team, I have a Project Manager which tells me that she doesn't expect
me to code at all in this project as a Tech Lead. This is where feedback is very important,
as per what every speakers have reiterated in the conference. No one talks about how
difficult systemising feedbacks are. Different people will have a different expectation of
you. I'm still always getting interesting feedback like "But you are a tech lead, not team
lead".

I don't know why everyone talks about embracing no coding and embrace the joy of leading.
That will give you a sheer of relief for a while. People want to learn from you as well.
What are you "leading" with if you can't code anymore? I wouldn't call myself a lead "developer"
if I don't code. I'll be a little controversial here, but you **have to** code a minimum of
30% in your team.

Successful software delivery. If you think coding is required to help you understand
what's going on in the project, do it.
