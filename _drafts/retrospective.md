After working for 7.5 years for Experian, I'm finally moving on to the second job of my life.
Looking back to all those years, I'm capturing the learnings in this post.

Anecdotal.

# The walking skeleton must walk

A walking skeleton is a practice that would work in various aspects of software development.
It would work in feature developments, deployment pipeline creation, or infrastructure
migration.
Creating a walking skeleton is about implementing the smallest possible amount of work to get
all of the important elements in place, *end-to-end*. More often than not, these skeletons
will not have their legs even after a couple of iterations. The practices required
for a skeleton to walk has proven to be hard, if not requiring a mastery.

The tendency of a new requirement is normally a running skeleton with gold plated feet. Slicing user
stories vertically and prioritising the slices is the key success. A lot of the user stories I've
seen are unfortunately sliced horizontally, which will not produce an end-to-end product.
Slicing vertically also applies in a deployment pipeline. The user stories you are doing
might only gold plate your build pipeline before you move on to your deployment, which will delay
the simplest end-to-end deployment pipeline that you can have earlier.

Once you have mastered creating a walking skeleton, you'll have to convince
your stakeholders or product owners. They will feel uncomfortable
if your team is delivering the very first feature as you'll be laying out
the invisible foundations. 

# Don't hide your passion
Most of us live in a non-programmer-friendly society.
We have words like geek or nerd which have negative connation to diss programmers. You are socially
expected to have 'life' after work. Of course, programming is not counted as 'life'. On the other hand,
most of the programmers I know are introverts, meaning they are quiet and will naturally not talk
about their passions. These two factors cause a vicious cycle which worsen our society.

To break that vicous cycle, we, who have passion in programming, should break out of our introvert bubble.
Talk about your passion more and don't be shy saying what you are doing at home.
You might not change the society much, but you would inspire the others who love
programming to do the same. There are
a lot of good things that wouldn't have happened if I did not show my passion.
I've got to know a lot of good programmers. I 
met passionate managers who have kindly given me guidance. Heck, it might be
why I got my job in the first place; Experian does not hire fresh graduates.

# You don't get what you don't ask
- role
- salary
- job scope
- It should be more natural for us programmer to negotiate with data?

# The recipe to fail
- Multiple stakeholders
- team allocation, 100%, no commitment
- Fragmentation of time
- Bureaucracy
- You can do things remotely, only with the best people.

# Productivity
- 15 mins rule, save people time: when you're stuck on something ... you have to try to solve the problem all by yourself for 15 min, but then when the 15 minutes are up you have to ask for help. Failure to do the former wastes people's time, failure to ask for help wastes your time.
- Set your own deadline
- Importance of work prioritise
- Work in batch.

# Reactive Management
- Difference between alignment and micro management. If your team is not deviating, you achieve 101 micro management
- jargon abuse: cross functional team recently
- change of priority
- theory of constraint
-- the phoenix project e.g. microservices
- High performing manager, neglecting their reporting lines
- accountability, focus on management
- Hiring: Find Dev who loves business challenges, not having fun on tech

# Value Chain / Impact
- Open Source
- Stack overflow
- If you write more than once, write a blog

Career capital
- Switch of build engineering
- Self organization
- Related to productivity?
