After working for 7.5 years for Experian, I'm finally moving on to the second job of my life.
Looking back to all those years, I'm capturing the learnings in this post.

Incremental Change is a skill / experience
- Will always work
- Hard to convince
- page designer, buttons aesthetic, control feature
- Walking skeleton
- Deployment pipeline incremental change
- Jenkins migration 
- Draw diagram
- Too many times including managements

Passion will get you far
- Seniors helped me grew. I was hired.
- Passion will get you far, Annan pairing, yip Wan helping etc. Finally kicked out.
- Passion from manager trumps KPI, ***REMOVED*** ***REMOVED***
- Focusing your passion, show graph of mine and average humans 

You don't get what you don't ask
- role
- salary
- job scope

The recipe to fail
- Multiple stakeholders
- team allocation, 100%, no commitment
- Fragmentation of time
- Bureaucracy
- You can do things remotely, only with the best people.

Productivity
- 15 mins rule, save people time: when you're stuck on something ... you have to try to solve the problem all by yourself for 15 min, but then when the 15 minutes are up you have to ask for help. Failure to do the former wastes people's time, failure to ask for help wastes your time.
- Set your own deadline
- Importance of work prioritise
- Work in batch.

Reactive Management
- Difference between alignment and micro management. If your team is not deviating, you achieve 101 micro management
- jargon abuse: cross functional team recently
- change of priority
- theory of constraint
-- the phoenix project e.g. microservices
- High performing manager, neglecting their reporting lines
- accountability, focus on management
- Hiring: Find Dev who loves business challenges, not having fun on tech

Value Chain / Impact
- Open Source
- Stack overflow
- If you write more than once, write a blog

Career capital
- Switch of build engineering
- Self organization
