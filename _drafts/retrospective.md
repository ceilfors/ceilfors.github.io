After working for 7.5 years for Experian, I'm finally moving on to the second job of my life.
Looking back to all those years, I'm capturing the learnings in this post.

# Incremental change
- Will always work
- Hard to convince
- page designer, buttons aesthetic, control feature
- Walking skeleton
- Deployment pipeline incremental change
- Jenkins migration 
- Draw diagram
- Too many times including managements
- slicing

# Don't hide your passion
Most of us live in a non-programmer-friendly society.
We have words like geek or nerd which have negative connation to diss programmers. You are socially
expected to have 'life' after work. Of course, programming is not counted as 'life'. On the other hand,
most of the programmers I know are introverts, meaning they are quiet and will naturally not talk
about their passions. These two factors cause a vicious cycle which worsen our society.

To break that vicous cycle, we, who have passion in programming, should break out of our introvert bubble.
Talk about your passion more and don't be shy saying what you are doing at home.
You might not change the society much, but you would inspire the others who love
programming to do the same. There are
a lot of good things that wouldn't have happened if I did not show my passion.
I've got to know a lot of good programmers. I 
met passionate managers who have kindly given me guidance. Heck, it might be
why I got my job in the first place; Experian does not hire fresh graduates.

# You don't get what you don't ask
- role
- salary
- job scope
- It should be more natural for us programmer to negotiate with data?

# The recipe to fail
- Multiple stakeholders
- team allocation, 100%, no commitment
- Fragmentation of time
- Bureaucracy
- You can do things remotely, only with the best people.

# Productivity
- 15 mins rule, save people time: when you're stuck on something ... you have to try to solve the problem all by yourself for 15 min, but then when the 15 minutes are up you have to ask for help. Failure to do the former wastes people's time, failure to ask for help wastes your time.
- Set your own deadline
- Importance of work prioritise
- Work in batch.

# Reactive Management
- Difference between alignment and micro management. If your team is not deviating, you achieve 101 micro management
- jargon abuse: cross functional team recently
- change of priority
- theory of constraint
-- the phoenix project e.g. microservices
- High performing manager, neglecting their reporting lines
- accountability, focus on management
- Hiring: Find Dev who loves business challenges, not having fun on tech

# Value Chain / Impact
- Open Source
- Stack overflow
- If you write more than once, write a blog

Career capital
- Switch of build engineering
- Self organization
- Related to productivity?
