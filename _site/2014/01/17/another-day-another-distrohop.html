    <p>Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Arch Linux, ArchBang, CrunchBang, and finally I did another distrohop to Debian. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m one of those <a href="http://jimlynch.com/linux-articles/the-psychology-of-a-distrohopper/">proud distrohopper</a> yet with this hop. Though my first few hops was quite intensive, CrunchBang has made me stayed for almost <a href="http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=27605">6 months</a>. I&#39;m also not in a quest to find a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=distrohopper">perfect distro</a>. What I really want now is just a <strong>stable enough</strong> distro. I need to balance getting things done and learning Linux. That&#39;s what the hop is all about. </p>

<h2>Before Debian</h2>

<p>Before I switched to Debian, I was a happy user of CrunchBang. Great community, groovy speed and very lightweight. A fresh boot only consumes roughly about 200 mb of my RAM. As a matter of fact, I will use CrunchBang if I need other Linux machine. So why is the hop?</p>

<h2>Living on the bleeding edge</h2>

<p>I switched to <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/sid/">Debian sid</a> in CrunchBang to live on the bleeding edge. The more problems I fix, the more I have learned. Unfortunately some of them just couldn&#39;t be fixed. Heck, or you can say that I had given up. I learnt a lot from the community in CrunchBang&#39;s IRC, but this time the response is:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you using sid? You have to wait a little bit longer, son.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are a couple of issues that annoyed me the most everyday:</p>

<ul>
<li>After a couple of times resuming my machine from <em>suspend mode</em>, I will get a constant freeze every 1 or 2 seconds. I have to restart my machine to fix this. That&#39;s means I can&#39;t suspend my machine!</li>
<li>SLiM gives me issues too. After I logged in, Openbox is just not responding to me. Only my wallpaper is shown. Using a login-shell was the workaround. Therefore, my booting up ritual is: 1) Go to Virtual terminal, 2) login, and 3) startx. Ugh.</li>
</ul>

<p>With those two of the above combined? A hop indeed. Some of the issues are happening because I did not RTFM properly too. I&#39;m guessing that I did not apt-pin my packages properly. For my future self, <a href="http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=16353">read all of this</a> next time!</p>
