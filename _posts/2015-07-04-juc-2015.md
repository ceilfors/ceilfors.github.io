This blog contains the report of my attendance for JUC 2015 - Europe in London. I only wrote
the bits that I find fresh to my brain and a set of keywords for researchability. More information
is captured by workingwithdevs.com liveblog: [day 1](http://workingwithdevs.com/liveblog-jenkins-conference-2015-1/),
[day 2](http://workingwithdevs.com/liveblog-jenkins-conference-2015-2/) (do note that we attended different talks).

# Deployment Pipeline
## Deployment techniques
A lot of talks in JUC were talking about [blue green deployment](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html)
i.e. Deploy green with new URL, slowly route everything to green, slowly remove blue when green is stable.
At [his talk](#d1pipeline), @sufyaan_kazi shows that CloudFoundry can act as the blue green deployment's
router implementation. CloudFoundry sells the idea that PaaS is the way to go for cloud as it will abstract
out the cloud implementation hence not restricting your application to a single cloud. [12factor.net](http://12factor.net/)
is a recommended reading.

[@markusrendall](#d2key) did a live demo to showcase their blue green deployment in AWS. This is the best
live demo shown in JUC. He added a twitter button to his web application during the demo and deployed it live.
The conference attendees can hit the URL live and see that
50% of the hit don't see the twitter button in their web page. Accenture referred this technique as
A/B deployment. Seems like [we haven't reached a consensus yet](https://cloudnative.io/blog/2015/02/the-dos-and-donts-of-bluegreen-deployment/)
on how we should call this technique.

Another deployment technique is [shown by @mariocruz](#d2noops) by using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Elastic Beanstalk
has an out of the box feature to [instantly swap URL in between boxes](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.CNAMESwap.html).
In summary, you deploy the new application in a new box, gain some confidence, switch your application URL to
your new application by a push of a button. As a CTO, he also shows the importance of how he can rollback
this URL swap from his mobile, again with a push of a button.

## Anti fragile design
Good mind shift from [@martincroker](#d2key), summary:

- Assume failure is unavoidable
- Focus on reducing failures impact, not reducing failures probability
- Reduce time to recover from failures

## Feature flags
Other than the Elastic Beanstalk showcase, @mariocruz also encourage us to adopt feature flags
for a smoother and a more flexible app deployment. I think
this is a synonym to [feature toggle](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html). He is using 
Netflix Archaius for his feature toggle implementation.

On the site note, he encourage the attendees repetitively that we
should check out [Netflix OSS](https://netflix.github.io/) as there are a lot of excellent freebies.

# Containerization
## New currency: Docker
In the [d1key](#d1key) and [d1tiger](#d1tiger), @kohsukekawa shows how he changed his deployment currency from
wars to containers. This is an absolute game changer in continuous delivery paradigm, everyone in the
deployment pipeline is interacting only with containers. Container is the new deployment package and
Jenkins will be the one who is creating these containers.

During the transition, Cloudbees was faced with some challenges and has made some Jenkins Docker plugins
to tackle them:

- [CloudBees Docker Build and Publish](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Docker+Build+and+Publish+plugin)  
  Adds a build step in Jenkins to build a Dockerfile and publish it to a docker registry.

- [CloudBees Docker Hub Notification](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Docker+Hub+Notification)  
  One of the glue to enable Docker as a new deployment currency. This plugin adds a trigger
  in a Jenkins job to listen to changes in docker registry.

- [CloudBees Docker Traceability](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Docker+Traceability)  
  We need some ways to identify which container is which when they are flowing through the pipeline. This plugin
  will help us trace the containers. It works like Jenkins fingerprint but for Docker containers.

- [CloudBees Docker Docker Custom Build Environment Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Docker+Custom+Build+Environment+Plugin)  
  Enables a job to build inside of a docker container. Supports dockerfile and image pulling from a repository.

The sample application that @kohsukekawa used during the demo can be found here:

- [docker-jenkins-demo-base](https://github.com/kohsuke/docker-jenkins-demo-base)  
  Contains the a server.xml that will be built onto a Docker container. This file is the file that
  he changed during the demo and being reflected after the deployment pipeline is completed.

- [docker-jenkins-demo-app](https://github.com/kohsuke/docker-jenkins-demo-app)  
  The web application source code that is used for the demo. The change of the server.xml is reflected in the 
  HTTP response header. Contains *Jenkinsfile*, which is a workflow-plugin script; interesting file naming
  convention.

## Container cluster
[@CamundaBPM talk](#d2container) talked about how they are running 6 Docker hosts as 1 swarm. The interesting bit is that 
they are using [Docker Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Docker+Plugin) to point to
[Docker swarm](https://github.com/docker/swarm). With this setup, the number of slaves are transparent
to Jenkins and we can dynamically add more hosts to the swarm to scale Jenkins builds.

In the [keynote](#d1key) however, @kohsukekawa was announcing that they will support [kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/).
Kubernetes features seems to be an 
[overlap](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27334934/what-is-the-difference-between-docker-swarm-and-kubernetes-mesophere)
or even a superset of Docker swarm.

## Pets and cattle
This is a funny analogy thrown by @martincroker during [his talk](#d2key).

| Pets | Cattle |
|---------|---------------------|
| Pets are given names like pussinboots.cern.ch | Cattle are given numbers like vm0042.cern.ch |
| They are unique, lovingly hand raised and cared for | They are almost identical to other cattle |
| When they get ill, you nurse them back to health | When they get ill, you get another one |
*Credits for the table above from [it20.info](http://it20.info/2012/12/vcloud-openstack-pets-and-cattle/)*

Of course, he encourages the attendees to use more cattle. The live demo by @markusrendall was showing that
all of their demo servers were cattles. They showcased a demo application that is using AWS Cloud Formation. When their JSON file
is deployed in the demo, all of the servers, nginx, node app (with A/B deployment), Jenkins, etc, 8 VM
with 4 separated subnets goes live. They had nothing but that single json file for all of those to be up. When those
servers are up, @markusrendall continued with the demo and ended it by tearing down all those servers.

# Automation test
## Real world automation test
There are lot of good stuffs from [@viktorclerc talk](#d1butler), check out his slides!

Some of the best bits I grasped:

- Test reports must support and *consolidate* multiple test tools reports.
  Don't try to standardize testing tools, it's impossible to achieve. Let the testers/developers use
  any tools they want, we should do the hardwork to create a custom reporting in Jenkins. It's more
  important to have tests rather than spending effort standardizing everything. The product they are trying
  to sell to achieve this is [XL Test View](https://xebialabs.com/products/xl-testview/).
- Realise that in real world we can still deploy with failing tests, hence each of the tests need
  to be labeled properly and visible to everyone. For example if Safari test is failing and there 
  are only 2% of our customers are using Safari, we can deploy them with "known failures". The Safari
  label here is important.
- The world is changing: Testing = Automation. Full stop, it's an equals symbol there. Testers are becoming developers.
- Speed of feedback is very important, radical parallelization is the key. Also kill the nightlies.

## Automated test tools
[Chaos monkey](http://blog.codinghorror.com/working-with-the-chaos-monkey/) is used by @mariocruz
to test his AWS instances. All these monkeys has now formed an army and become
[Simian Army](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy/wiki).

An alternative to JMeter was used by @markusrendall during his live demo: [gatling](http://gatling.io/). Not much information
about it were provided in the talk.

Masoon Jan is using [FitNesse](http://www.fitnesse.org/) as a tool to do an acceptance test. This test is integration in his
deployment pipeline.

# Jenkins optimization

## Workflow plugin
This plugin was boasted last year and shockingly has been adopted by a lot of speakers in JUC.
Workflow plugin is developed by @tyvole and @kohsukekawa in CloudBees. Jenkins core's code has
been modified a lot to support this plugin ever since the development of this plugin was started.
Some of the plugin features are only available in Jenkins Enterprise e.g. checkpoints.

## Jenkins Blueprint 
[Jonathan Zenou](#d2rebuild) shared a blueprint for his entire Jenkins setup. The blueprint can be found
[here](http://www.ravellosystems.com/repo/blueprints/60391436). Supposingly anyone can just
use that blueprint, spin up Jenkins and browse around the configuration (I haven't tried this yet).
He shared a lot of plugins that he used to tackle common problems in Jenkins.
Most of these can also be seen in his slides.

## Failure management
Lots of times developers don't bother to read the entire Jenkins output console and will ask you, the
maintainer of Jenkins, to find out what the problem is. Most of the times the cause of the failure is obvious,
but it is hard to find as they are in the middle of all other errors.
[Build Failure Analyzer](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Failure+Analyzer)
provides a knowledge base by scanning your console output and provide a meaninful description of the error in 
the build page. Over time your knowledge base will grow and you will have less context switch!

Pushing for Continuous Integration requires dicipline from developers to fix the broken build as
quick as possible.
Showing a build failure with a big fat red panel will certainly help. Shared by [Masoon Jan](#d1retailer),
he is using [Build Monitor Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Monitor+Plugin) to achieve
this.

## Retaining Jenkins build history
In [his talk](#d2release), Robert McNulty was showing how he can retain Jenkins build
history by using Groovy and Neo4j. He basically stores all of the build environment and any other specific
information that he wants from a particular Jenkins build to Neo4j. After a certain
period of time, this data can used for auditing or reviewing. He showed how Neo4j dashboard
can display those data in an interesting graphs ouf of the box.

# Software compliance
I didn't manage to capture much information here, but if there is one speaker that talks about
this topic it's [@IlkkaTurunen from Sonatype](#d1enterprise). He showed how putting a colour and code for
compliance in Jenkins dashboard would help. The importance of compliance for large financial
or technology firms were also shown by some statistics in Maven Central e.g. average
downloads with known vulnerabilities, percentage with known defective parts, component downloads
with known defects older than 2013, percentage with known defects older than 2013, etc. I vaguely remembered
that he was showing "Application composition report", most likely it's a part of the software that
they are selling called Sonatype CLM.

# Others tools worth mentioning

- Phabricrator: JIRA + Confluence + FishEye + Stash + HipChat all bundled together for free!
- Terraform: Like CloudFormation but cloud agnostic. Can be used for AWS and OpenStack. I might be oversimplifying, Google it out yourself.
- IBM Bluemix: PaaS from IBM.

# Summary
Test code as a source code, Infrastructure as a code, everything as a code,
the new common language in DevOps is [code](https://twitter.com/smeyen/status/613270593803259904).
